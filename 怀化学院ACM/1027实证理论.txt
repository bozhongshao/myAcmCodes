Description 

For hundreds of years Fermat's Last Theorem, which stated simply that for n > 2 there exist no integers a, b, c > 1 such that a^n = b^n + c^n, has remained elusively unproven. (A recent proof is believed to be correct, though it is still undergoing scrutiny.) It is possible, however, to find integers greater than 1 that satisfy the "perfect cube" equation a^3 = b^3 + c^3 + d^3 (e.g. a quick calculation will show that the equation 12^3 = 6^3 + 8^3 + 10^3 is indeed true). This problem requires that you write a program to find all sets of numbers {a,b,c,d} which satisfy this equation for a <= N. 


Input 

One integer N (N <= 100).

Output 

The output should be listed as shown below, one perfect cube per line, in non-decreasing order of a (i.e. the lines should be sorted by their a values). The values of b, c, and d should also be listed in non-decreasing order on the line itself. There do exist several values of a which can be produced from multiple distinct sets of b, c, and d triples. In these cases, the triples with the smaller b values should be listed first. 


Sample Input 


6

Sample Output 


Cube = 6, Triple = (3,4,5)
